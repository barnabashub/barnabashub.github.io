I was bored that Google had to delete Google Maps redirecting from the Google Search. So I just did a chromium extension. It's free, please use it!

If you have any questions feel free to contact me. 

You can find everything about it here: [![GMaps in Search](https://img.shields.io/badge/Button-Text-blue)](https://barnabashub.github.io/gmaps-redirect/)

Install the extension from here: [![Chrome Web Store](https://img.shields.io/badge/Button-Text-blue)](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gmaps-redirector/plnpaajlpdgedhpgmdfkomjdhfghndid)
